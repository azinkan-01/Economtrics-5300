## RESEARCH QUESTION:

The College Scorecard was released at the start of September 2015. Among colleges that predominantly grant bachelorâ€™s degrees, did the release of the Scorecard shift student interest to high-earnings colleges relative to low-earnings ones (as proxied by Google searches for keywords associated with those colleges)?

REQ:
- You will need to produce at least one regression and one graph for your analysis, and explain them.

## Overview of Data

```{}
summary(DataDictRaw)
```
Notable Observations

- 1295 unique different variables
- Full Data Dict Available In Apedex()

``` {}
summary(IDNameLinkRaw)

```
Data set holds unique ids for the universities searched

- opeid: 8-digit OPE ID for institution
- unitid: Unit ID for institution
- schname: the search school name

``` {}
IDNameLinkRaw %>% 
  group_by(opeid) %>%
  summarise(count_unique = n_distinct(opeid)) %>% 
  arrange(., desc(count_unique))
```
Primary Key: both opeid & unitid are primary keys

```{}
summary(MostRecentRaw)

```
Data set holds 122 unique variables which are directly associated with out primary key combination
- opeid: 8-digit OPE ID for institution
- unitid: Unit ID for institution

Holds a variety of information about the school such as:
- school type
- location
- size
- admission rate
- standard entry test score distributions
- degree ypes awarded
- race 
- price
- etc..

Primary Key: both opeid & unitid are primary keys

``` {}
summary(TrendsUpToFinishRaw)
head(TrendsUpToFinishRaw)

```
Data set holds panel data for each university and key word index rating over time.
index ranged from 1-100 (this is relative to the school) indexes are not comparable directly
Primary Key: schid & keynum & monthorweek


``` {}
summary(TrendsUpToInter_1_Raw)
head(TrendsUpToInter_1_Raw)

```
``` {}
summary(TrendsUpToUphoenixRaw)
head(TrendsUpToUphoenixRaw)

```
TrendsUpToInter_1_Raw - 6 are identical sets buts account for different schools.
These tables are also the same structure but represent different school sets

- TrendsUpToUmRaw
- TrendsUpToUphoenixRaw
- TrendsUpToUtRaw
- TrendsUpToUtmbRaw
- TrendsUpToYorktowneRaw
- unioned Data sets 1-6 would make full set of TrendsUpToInter Data

Data set holds panel data for each university and key word index rating over time.
index ranged from 1-100 (this is relative to the school) indexes are not comparable directly
Primary Key: schid & keynum & monthorweek
