## Describe data
#### _Google Trends_

```{r}
# schname
di <- describe(google_trends_master)
print(di[3])
```
Note that we have 1386 unique university observations accountitng for a total of 733823 records. 
No Null values
```{r}
# time frame data
print(di[5])
```

```{r}
# index info
print(di[6:8])
```

```{r}
# normalized index info
print(di[10:11])
```
```{r}
# normalized index info
print(di[9])
```
Note that we have lopsided data (only 19% of our records are taken after the score card came out)
we'll want to adjust our sample to be random and more even distribution of true and false records. 


#### _selecting random sample_

```{r}
# Before
table(google_trends_master$after_score_card)

under_sample <- SMOTE(after_score_card ~ ., google_trends_master, perc.over = 600,perc.under=100)

table(under_sample$after_score_card)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results= "hide", warning = FALSE}

# plot density for the index rankings
ggplot(google_trends_master, aes(x= as.numeric(index), fill=after_score_card, alpha = 0.4)) + 
  geom_density()

```
No major change in distributions of indexing before vs after score card release

```{r, echo=FALSE, results= "hide", warning = FALSE}

# plot density for the index rankings
ggplot(google_trends_master, aes(x= as.numeric(standard_idx), fill=after_score_card, alpha = 0.4)) + 
  geom_density()

```
No major change in distributions of indexing before vs after score card release


## index over time

#### _ school master data_

```{r}

```

#### _Vars of interest
```{r}

```

#### Join the final df at whatever level of detail is needed for mastereed set
```{r}

```

#### _add features_ 

```{r}
# then add features, interactions, strip month, look for difference or change in metrics each week 
# This section we'll identify high earning school/ how and why, etc.  
```

## Identify "high-earning" and "low-earning" Earning Schools
Our research questions states “high-earning” vs “low-earning” colleges earning, so how can we define “high” vs “low”?
Earning Variables of interest:

- mn_earn_wne_p10
- md_earn_wne_p10-REPORTED-EARNINGS (One that was called to attention for the project)
- pct10_earn_wne_p10
- pct25_earn_wne_p10
- pct75_earn_wne_p10
- pct90_earn_wne_p10
- sd_earn_wne_p10
- count_wne_inc1_p10
- count_wne_inc2_p10
- count_wne_inc3_p10

#### _Distributions on earnings among colleges_
```{r}
# Histogram overlaid with kernel density curve
ggplot(shool_master, aes(x=md_reported_ern_10yr)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
                   binwidth=100,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666", stat="count")  # Overlay with transparent density plot
```

This graph represents the density of "median earnings of graduates ten years after graduation for each college".
Density in this case is the count of colleges that fall in that earning spectrum.

This plot has a lot of noise in it though so lets smooth it out. 
```{r}
ggplot(shool_master, aes(x= as.numeric(md_reported_ern_10yr))) + geom_density()

```

Now that the data is smoothed we get a better perspective of the distribution of earnings. 
We can see tho that this data is skewed to the right, indicating that while most schools median earning 10 years after graduation tends to fall right around 40,000 we have select schools who report very high earnings above 150,000. 

to adjust for the skew and normalizes the data a bit we'll take the log of earnings
```{r}
ggplot(shool_master, aes(x= log(as.numeric(md_reported_ern_10yr)))) + geom_density()
```
Now we can see that the data more closely represents a normalized curve when represented as a log().
This indicate that if we are to use the earnings in this analysis (Which we are) we should probaly explore its representation inits log() form. 

Storing the log value as a column. 
```{r,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shool_master <- shool_master %>%
  mutate(log_mean_10_yr_earnings = log(md_reported_ern_10yr))
```

This also tells us that when setting the "High" vs "Low" Earning schools we will not want to accept the mean as a splitting point as very high or very low earning shools have the ability to skew the mean value

The first way i would attempt to set the "High" Vs "Low" cut off point is by looking at the data dictionary. 
Looking at the data dictionary income/ earning levels are consistently categorized as the following:

- low-income (less than $30,000)
- middle-income (between $30,000 and $75,000)
- high-income (above $75,000)

Since this is the standard according to the data dictionary i dont think it would be wrong to follow suit in our classification.
SO we'll add this classification as a feature for later use.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shool_master <- shool_master %>%
  mutate(Income_level_standard = case_when(as.numeric(md_reported_ern_10yr) < 30000 ~ 'Low',
                             as.numeric(md_reported_ern_10yr) > 75000 ~ 'High',
                             TRUE ~ 'Med'))
```

Using this classification of high vs low however cuts out the mean of my sample population though and a majority of my observations so ill want to address this differently.  

#### _median_
For this ill be splitting it on the median for the entire sample. Selecting not to use mean here as earnings as we saw graphically (above) are highly skewed, median however will help us get a less skewed center. 

```{r}
# median earnings
median_val = median(shool_master$md_reported_ern_10yr)
print(paste("median value is", median_val))
shool_master <- shool_master %>%
  mutate(Inc_High_Low = case_when(md_reported_ern_10yr <= median_val ~ 'Low',
                             TRUE ~ 'High'))

```

#### _modeling_
```{r}
# start modeling (use what you have learned in class)
# plots and scatter plots
```

### Missing Data This should go up as part of  variable selection
```{r}
# Finding % of nulls
# MostRecentNA <- map(MostRecentRaw, ~mean(is.na(.)))
# MostRecentNA

```

We have quite a few columns that have a high proportion of Null values. 
Some of these these should likely be eliminated from the study unless we have a good reason not to. 



No particularly high missing data in Trends.

```{r}
# unique_keyword_count <- TrendsAppendedDf %>% 
#   group_by(schname) %>%
#   summarise(count_unique = n_distinct(keyword)) %>% 
#   arrange(., desc(count_unique))
```


Number of unique words beeing tracker per school. Some schools have more words tracked for them than others. 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Histogram overlaid with kernel density curve
# ggplot(unique_keyword_count, aes(x=count_unique)) + 
#     geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
#                    binwidth=.5,
#                    colour="black", fill="white") +
#     geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")  # Overlay with transparent density plot
```
